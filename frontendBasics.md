# React

## Tutorial Completed
I followed the official React getting started documentation using Vite to set
up a new React project. This covered basic project structure, running a local
development server, and creating a simple component.

## Development Environment Setup
The following tools were installed and configured locally:
- Node.js
- npm
- Vite
- React

The application runs locally using the development server and updates correctly
when changes are made.

## Hello World Application
A basic React application was created to confirm the setup was working.

The application:
- Starts successfully in the browser
- Renders a simple “Hello World” message
- Uses a functional React component

This confirms the frontend environment is working correctly.

## Core Concepts Learned
The following core concepts were introduced and used:

- React components
- JSX syntax
- Basic project structure
- Running and stopping the development server

These concepts are sufficient to begin building frontend features in future
sprints.
