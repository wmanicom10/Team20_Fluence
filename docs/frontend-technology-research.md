# Frontend Technology Research

## Option 1: React

React is a JavaScript library that uses components to build user interfaces.

**Pros**
- Commonly used for data-driven web applications
- Works well with REST APIs
- Large community and many learning resources
- Component structure helps keep code organized

**Cons**
- Requires learning JSX and basic React concepts
- More setup than plain JavaScript

**Learning Curve**
- Manageable with tutorials and documentation


## Option 2: Vue.js

Vue is a JavaScript framework that is similar to React but has a simpler syntax.

**Pros**
- Easier to read and write at first
- Good official documentation
- Uses a clear component structure

**Cons**
- Smaller ecosystem than React
- Less commonly used than React

**Learning Curve**
- Low 


## Option 3: Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This option uses only standard web technologies without a framework.

**Pros**
- Very little setup required
- No framework-specific concepts to learn
- Simple to start with

**Cons**
- No built-in structure for components or state
- Harder to manage as the project grows
- More manual organization required

**Learning Curve**
- Low initially, but increases as complexity increases


## Recommendation
React is the best choice for us. It provides enough structure to keep the
project organized over the semester while still working well with a backend
API. Vue would also work, but React is more commonly used and better supported
for this type of project.
